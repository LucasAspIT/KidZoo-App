# KidZoo-App

A small app made for practice.


*Allows the user to login (via Firebase), and view some animals, with pictures, and information about them.

*The database (via Firebase) saves some information about registered users. (Name, Address, Phone number, e-mail, birthday, reigster date.)

*All users have a personal log they can write in, which is saved via PlayerPrefs.

*An administrator has access to CRUD, so the ability to create animals, read animas (view their info like users do), update animals, and delete animals.

*UnitTests are also included, for testing of the most important parts of the app.



*Optionally, AR may be included. It would work by showing a specific image of an animal (you'd have printed out) on your camera, and it would start animating the image.
